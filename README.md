# VSRender
A simple project of mine to learn about the vulkan api and 3d graphics in general

## Building
I have a little script for quick compilation, in the scripts directory.
Just execute in the root dir of the project the following:
```
./scripts/build.sh -b
```

## Running
Now you can run either the ```./main``` file directly or use the script with the ```-r``` arg
